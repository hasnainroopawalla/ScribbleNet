<i>ScribbleNet</i> is Python library that classifies hand-drawn doodles into distinct classes (trained on the [QuickDraw dataset by Google](https://github.com/googlecreativelab/quickdraw-dataset)).

This Python package is bundled as a REST API using [Flask](https://flask.palletsprojects.com/en/2.0.x/) and deployed on [Heroku](https://www.heroku.com/).

The front-end is built using vanilla JavaScript, HTML and CSS.

Download the Android App here ([Google Play](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=doodle.classifier)).
>  The repository has recently been refactored and thus, the Android application currently doesn't work.

### Pre-processing
- Two pre-processing pipelines (for training, predicting on external data) have been created. Refer to `scribblenet.preprocessor.PreProcessor` ([source](https://github.com/hasnainroopawalla/ScribbleNet/blob/b645e1c1299784faebbce4f7efbbdd67758bae0b/scribblenet/preprocessing/preprocessor.py#L19)).

### Training
- A `Jupyter` notebook for training the model on the Quickdraw Dataset can be found [here](https://github.com/hasnainroopawalla/ScribbleNet/blob/master/scribblenet/ml/training.ipynb).
- The notebook uses utility methods from the `scribblenet` package for loading and preprocessing the data.
- The `load_classes()` method accepts `100` or `all` as an argument to indicate if 100 classes or all 345 classes should be loaded.
- The `load_dataset()` method accepts `num_samples_per_class` as an argument to indicate how many samples of each class should be loaded.
